# IBM JAVA terminology
1. A binary operation which takes two given sets and yields a set made up of all the items in the first set that are not in the second set
   **Answer. Set difference**
2.  collection of key-value pairs that associate a key with a value
  **Answer. map**
3.  a hierarchical structure  taht place the elements in nodes along  branches that originate from a root 
  **Answer. map**
4. a tree structure  in wich each node can have at most two children, and in which a unique path exist from the root to every other node  
 **Answer. map**
5. a type of tree in which the key value of each node is less than every key value in its right subtree,and greater than every key value in its left subtree

A binary tree in which ali the leaves are and ever,'
A hlr,ary tree is either leaves on the last level
J.
two children
J.
A complete binary in which each node has in that is greater than or equal to
us far the a.s possible
K.
the value in enh off Its
Nodes in a binary that only NULL Children
A node in does not .h2ve a parent
A data consis:s of a sct ot'nadcs and set ot-edges that relate the nodes to each other
N.
A graph in which each edge directed liern one '.ertex to another (or the same) vertex
A graph in which vertex directly connected to every other vertex
A graph in vv+lich carries a vaiue
R. A sequential structure thal divided into b buckets, each bucket with s slots. Each slot holds one
element, The address of an identifier X in the structure is gotten by computing some arithmetic function
This occurs- when 2 identifiers are hashed into the same bucket #
A method for finding the shortest path from one vertex to another in a yeigbted digraph—
A graph traversaf method thét visits the nodes from a starting vertex "level by level"
An assertion based test generator tool for software testing
