1. A binary operation which takes two given sets and yields a set made up of all the items in the first set that are not in the second set

        **Answer. Set difference**

2.  collection of key-value pairs that associate a key with a value

            **Answer. map**

3.  a hierarchical structure  taht place the elements in nodes along  branches that originate from a root 

**Answer. map**

4. a tree structure  in wich each node can have at most two children, and in which a unique path exist from the root to every other node  
 **Answer. map**

5. a type of tree in which the key value of each node is less than every key value in its right subtree,and greater than every key value in its left subtree

6. A type of binary tree in which the height  of each node's subtrees differs by no more than one.

7. A two dimensional structure that corresponds to a row-column table of entries of a especified dara type. 

8. A binary tree in which all of the leaves are on the same level and every non leaf node has exatly two children.

9. A binary tree that is either full or full through the next to last level, with the leaves on the last level as far to the left as posible

10. A complete binary in which each node has a value stored in it  that is greater than or equal to the value in each of its children

11. Nodes in a binary tree that only NULL Children.

12. A node in a binary tree that does not have a parent

13. A data structure consist of a set of nodes and set of-edges that relate the nodes to each other

14. A graph in which each edge directed from one vertex to another (or the same) vertex

15. A graph in which vertex directly connected to every other vertex

16. A graph in which each edge carries a value

17. A sequential structure thal divided into b buckets, each bucket with s slots. Each slot holds one
element, The address of an identifier X in the structure is gotten by computing some arithmetic function
This occurs- when 2 identifiers are hashed into the same bucket #ç

18. A method for finding the shortest path from one vertex to another in a weigbted digraph—
19. A graph traversaf method thét visits the nodes from a starting vertex "level by level"
20. An assertion based test generator tool for software testing
